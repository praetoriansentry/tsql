* TSQL Formatter

I use Microsoft SQL Server all the time at work.  I've been having a
very difficult time finding a formatter for Transact SQL that formats
the code in a way that I like.  Since I couldn't find one, I thought
it would be a good idea to write one!

It has also be quite difficult to find a good lexer / parser for
TSQL.  The only one that I could find was part of the SQL Server
class library.  Check [[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sqlserver.management.sqlparser.parser.aspx][here]] for more details.

** Future Stuff

- Add configuration support
- Properly indentation for ~AND~ and ~OR~ clauses that are nested
  within parenthesis
- Add unit testing?
- For special cases like ~CREATE~, ~UPDATE~, ~DELETE~ reset the
  clause stack... assuming these aren't statements.
- Making the spacing around ()'s more normal
